# User_Profile_Classification

In attempt to, not only apply machine learning tools to Web3, but also understand the unbiquitious data collected on users activiies via layer 1
blockchain architecture, I present a clean, optimized data engineering notebook that quieries, engineers and derives a dataset ready for exploration and
machine learning application.

We aim to test the hypothesis that clear user profiles exist capable of providing detailed personas for product and feature development, 
user acceptance, market growth modeling, demand planning, conversion rate, etc.

Please see the PDF describing the motivation for this project, the project plan, and the team involved.
